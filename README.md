## Prerequisites

Your linux distribution needs to be able to run shell scripts with bash. It should be at least a bash version that includes `printf`.

Currently the `slot` folder expects to be placed within the following folder hierarchy within your home folder: `~/scripts/bash/slot`.

To see if some UI functionality is working, try running `bash testui.sh` from the slot folder. This should print some test results and show some ui animations if everything works.


## Author
These probably not quite so well-written bash scripts were written by Hein Huijskes in an attempt to better learn the bash language.
